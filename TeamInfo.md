## Project Summary

Our project is meant to help users find recipes given a list of user-given ingredients. This recommendation feature can allow users to choose from a list of generated recipes (selected from a recipe database), that users can sort based on a variety of metrics, including the difficulty of the recipe, # of ingredients, relevance of recipe based on their available ingredients, etc. We also plan on implementing a journal feature where users can write about and journal their cooking experiences after making their recipe.
We hope that this project and website can allow users to easily cook recipes based on ingredients that are already easily accessible in their own fridges, which may decrease the chances of food wastage (as users may be more prone to throw out food ingredients that they donâ€™t use) and we also hope this application will lead to healthier choices, as users would be encouraged to cook their own recipes instead of eating outside, and would also save time, as users could cook recipes from accessible ingredients instead of going outside to buy them.
