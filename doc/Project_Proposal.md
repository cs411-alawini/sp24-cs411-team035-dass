### Project Title: Recipe Builder

### Project Summary
Our project is meant to help users find recipes given a list of user-given ingredients. This recommendation feature can allow users to choose from a list of generated recipes (selected from a recipe database), that users can sort based on a variety of metrics, including the difficulty of the recipe, # of ingredients, relevance of recipe based on their available ingredients, etc. We also plan on implementing a journal feature where users can write about and journal their cooking experiences after making their recipe.
We hope that this project and website can allow users to easily cook recipes based on ingredients that are already easily accessible in their own fridges, which may decrease the chances of food wastage (as users may be more prone to throw out food ingredients that they don’t use) and we also hope this application will lead to healthier choices, as users would be encouraged to cook their own recipes instead of eating outside, and would also save time, as users could cook recipes from accessible ingredients instead of going outside to buy them.

### Description

What would be a good creative component (technically challenging function) that can improve the functionality of your application? (What is something cool that you want to include? How are you planning to achieve it?)
When the user types in the ingredients, this app will recommend the possible recipes that can be made with those ingredients. And those recommendations would be sorted and filtered by the users’ preference and also the number of common ingredients with the recipe and user’s input.  The purpose of this is to reduce the waste of ingredients that users have and give convenience to find the possible recipes instead of searching on Google. 

A good creative component would be to have the ability for the user to upload a picture of their recipe or have the UI be a journal where the user could write about their cooking experience. This would improve functionality of your application as the user. We are planning to achieve this by including a text feature (interactive text box with user input) where users can write about their food experiences, which can help them keep a log/history of all the recipes. 

### Usefulness

This application is useful because it provides users with a functional and creative way for them to use products that they already have at home. There are simple features such as searching, and filtering, but also more complex features where we can add better UI features, and even a record keeping journal feature where users can input logs of the recipes they created. This journal feature will allow users to create journal entries and save them based on the recipes they want to create entries for. Furthermore, we will include functionality for users to save/favorite/bookmark recipes to look back at later. 

The basic functions of our application allow users to enter the app and input the ingredients they have, and the application recommends a list of recipes that the user could make with the list. Something that makes our application different is that we also incorporate nutritional facts in our recipes. Most websites will only show nutritional information, or only show recipes, but we incorporate both in our application to provide ease and convenience to the user by having it all in one place. We also incorporate a journaling system, which makes the application more personal and serves a unique purpose for users to document their experiences with the recipes.	

### Realness

The database we are using: 
(Primary) 
#### Recipe Dataset (over 2M) Foods
2 million recipes, all from baking to French cuisine, and everything in between
Has information of ingredients and directions for the recipes
The data size of 1312871 distinct recipes and 7 columns. The data is in CSV format.

(Support) 
#### Nutritional Facts for most common foods
Gives the information about nutrients in the food such as Fat, Carbs, Proteins, etc.
The data size of  329 ingredients dishes and 10 columns. The data is in CSV format.

### Functionality 
This is where you talk about what the website delivers. Talk about how a user would interact with the application (i.e., things that one could create, delete, update, or search for). Read the requirements for stage 4 to see what other functionalities you want to provide to the users. You should include:

### A low-fidelity UI mockup:

### Project work distribution: 
Who will be responsible for each of the tasks or subtasks?

Explain how backend systems will be distributed across members. Be as specific as possible as this could be part of the final peer evaluation metrics.
